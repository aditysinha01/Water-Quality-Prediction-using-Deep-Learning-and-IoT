•	A real time Water Quality prediction model built with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models and algorithms with Arduino UNO R3 code to display on software.
•	The project includes finding values of 4 parameters – pH value, TDS, Turbidity value and Conductivity.
•	With the help of dataset models were trained and were used to find out the accuracy of the models based on those values.
